1형식 : S+V (주어 + 동사)

We walked 
The sun shines
She didn't appear
Many fans gathered

2형식 : S+V+C (주어+동사+보어)

I am a student
He's busy now
The elevator is out of order
The prize for the winner is a trip to Boston
The situation got worse
I stayed awake all night
Painting became my great love
She looks angry
I feel exhausted lately
