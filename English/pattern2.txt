[1]
I'm used to it
I'm used to you
I'm used to the noise
I'm used to this stuff
I'm used to the cold

[2]
I'm afraid I can't make it
I'm afraid I can't help you
I'm afraid I don't understand
I'm afraid I'll be late
I'm afraid I don't have time

[3]
I'm sure you did a good job
I'm sure you can do it
I'm sure you'll do better next time
I'm sure you'll have fun
I'm sure things will work out

[4]
I'm not sure we can park here
I'm not sure I can do it
I'm not sure I understand
I'm not sure it's possible
I'm not sure you remember me
