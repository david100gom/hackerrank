[11]
I'm not going to read it

Aren't you worried?

[21]
I want to thank you
I want to go to sleep
I want to be with you
I want to know everything

[22]
I don't want to tell you
I don't want to be late
I don't want to go to work
I don't want to do anything

[23]
You don't want to miss
You don't want to know
You don't want to do that
You don't want to hear that

[24]
Do you want to leave?
Do you want to try some?
Do you want to go with me?
Do you want to watch a movie?

[25]
I just wanted to check
I just wanted to say hello
I just wanted to thank you
I just wanted to talk to you

[26]
I think I love you

I think it's a good idea
I think we need to talk

[27]
Do you think the knows?
Do you think it'll be OK?
Do you think he'll come?
Do you think this is right?

[28]
Don't you think so?
Don't you think it's funny?
Don't you think it's too much?
Don't you think we should go?

[29]
I know it's over
I know it's crazy
I know it's difficult
I know it's too late

[30]
I don't know why I like this
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I said that
I don't know why that happened

[31]
I mean, it's OK
I mean, I want this
I mean, you're right
I mean, it's a problem

[32]
I didn't mean to do that
I didn't mean to say that
I didn't mean to be rude
I didn't mean to hurt you

[33]
I like your idea
I like your smile
I like your clothes

[34]
I like to travel
I like to read a book
I like to listen to music
I like to try new things

[35]
I don't like to wait
I don't like to cook
I don't like to drive
I don't like to study

[36]
It's like a movie
It's like a dream
It's lika a miracle
It's like a nightmare

[37]
It sounds like fun
It sounds like a problem
It sounds like an excuse
It sounds like a good idea

[38]
I'd like to know
I'd like to order
I'd like to ask you
I'd like to thank you

[39]
Would you like to eat?
Would you like to see?
Would you like to join us?
Would you like to sign up?

[40]
Can I get a ride?
Can I get a refund?
Can I get a discount?
Can I get more water?

[41]
Can I get you a drink?
Can I get you a chair?
Can I get you a towel?
Can I get you anything?

[42]
Can't you see that?
Can't you hear me?
Can't you just stop?
Can't you do better?

[43]
You can have it
You can have mine
You can have more time
You can have some coffee

[44]
I can't think of one
I can't think of his name
I can't think of a solution
I can't think of a good reason

[45]
I can't wait to see you
I can't wait to be there
I can't wait to go to bed
I can't wait to watch the movie

[46]
I can't stand this guy
I can't stand the noise
I can't stand the music
I can't stand it anymore

[47]
It can't be true
It can't be easy
It can't be possible
It can't be any better

[48]
It's just a cold
It's just a game
It's just an excuse
It's just a coincidence

[49]
It's not just a joke
It's not just for me
It's not just an idea
It's not just a dream

[50]
It's nice to be back
It's nice to meet you
It's nice to talk to you
It's nice to work with you

[51]
It's time to go
It's time to stop
It's time to get up
It's time to take a break

[52]
It's hard to believe
It's hard to explain
It's hard to understand
It's hard to say goodbye

[53]
It's worth it
It's worth a try
It's worth noting
It's worth the wait

[54]
There's a way
There's a plan
There's a reason
There's a difference

[55]
Is there any news?
Is there a problem?
Is there anyone here?
Is there anything else?

[56]
There's nothing left
There's nothing to do
There's nothing to tell
There's nothing wrong

[57]
There was a lot of food 
There was a lot of traffic
There was a lot of money
There was a lot of work to do

[58]
There must be a reason
There must be a problem
There must be a mistake
There must be a better way

[59]
That's what I like
That's what I said
That's what I thought
That's what he wants

[60]
That's why I'm here
That's why I like you
That's why I had to quit
That's why I didn't come

[61]
This is the only way 
This is the only reason
This is the only answer
This is the only difference
