I'm used to it
I'm used to you
I'm used to the noise
I'm used to this stuff
I'm used to the cold

[2]
I'm afraid I can't make it
I'm afraid I can't hlep you
I'm afraid I don't understand
I'm afraid I'll be late
I'm afraid I don't have time

[3]
I'm sure you did a good job
I'm sure you can do it
I'm sure you'll do better next time
I'm sure you'll have fun
I'm sure things will work out

[4]
I'm not sure we can park here
I'm not sure I can do it
I'm not sure I understand
I'm not sure it's possible
I'm not sure you remember me

[5]
Are you sure you want to know?
Are you sure you want to go?
Are you sure you can do this?
Are you sure you want to quit?
Are you sure you don't want any?

[6]
I'm saying I'm sorry 
I'm saying I love you
I'm saying it's not true
I'm saying I like it
I'm saying I don't understand

[7]
I'm not saying you should leave
I'm not saying it'll be easy
I'm not saying I hate you
I'm not saying this is perfect
I'm not saying I'm always right

[8]
I'm not talking about you
I'm talking about my boyfriend
I'm talking about a TV show
I'm talking about my friend
I'm not talking about your appearance

[9]
Are you talking about the book?
Are you talking about us?
Are you talking about the movie?
Are you talking about me?
Are you talking about my friend?

[10]
Are you planning to come back?
Are you planning to stay?
Are you planning to travel?
Are you planning to come here?
Are you planning to rent a car?

[11]
I was no longer a child
I was no longer there
I was no longer working
I was no longer interested
I was no longer sure

[12]
I was asked to do it
I was asked to meet
I was asked to leave
I was asked to make a speech
I was asked to help out
