It's hard to say goodbye

[53]
It's worth it
It's worth a try
It's worth noting
It's worth the wait

[54]
There's a way
There's a plan
There's a reason
There's a difference

[55]
Is there any news?
Is there a problem?
Is there anyone here?
Is there anything else?

[56]
There's nothing left

There's nothing wrong

[57]
There was a lot of food
