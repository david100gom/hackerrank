[1]
I'm on it
I'm on a diet
I'm on a break
I'm on my way
I'm on a trip
I'm on a date

[2]
I'm afraid of you
I'm afraid of heights
I'm afraid of the dark
I'm afraid of everything

[3]
I'm about to leave
I'm about to tell you
I'm about to go home
I'm about to watch a movie

[4]
I'm here to help
I'm here to work
I'm here to see you
I'm here to talk to you

[5]
I'm not here to fight
I'm not here to compete
I'm not here to judge you
I'm not here to say I'm sorry

[6]
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to start
I'm ready to learn
I'm ready to change

[7]
I'm sorry I'm late
I'm sorry to hear that
I'm sorry to bother you
I'm sorry you feel that way

[8]
I'm worried about my friend
I'm worried about my parents
I'm worried about the weather
I'm worried about your health

[9]
I'm interested in you
I'm interested in this
I'm interested in your offer
I'm interested in the position

[10]
I'm going to go
I'm going to sleep
I'm going to help you
I'm going to lose weight

[11]
I'm not going to read it
I'm not going to tell you
I'm not going to work today
I'm not going to leave you alone

[12]
I'm trying to think
I'm trying to help you
I'm trying to apologize
I'm trying to do my best
