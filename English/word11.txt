I'm not sure I agree with them.

I'm not sure I agree with either you or Tina

That's a good point, but... : 일리는 있지만~
That's a good point, but I can't agree

I'm convinced we should reject their offer. It's way too low

What I mean is... ? : 제 뜻은 ~이라는 겁니다
What I mean is I don't agree

Barbara, our company is now in the top ten.

Does anyone...?
Does anyone have an opinion about this?

Does anyone want to propose a different option?
I do. I think we should consider building the factory in Ulsan

We already have suppliers there. In China, we don't

Let's hear from : ~에게 들어 봅시다.
Let's hear from Ted

Now, let's move onto.. :자 ~으로 넘어갑시다
Now, let's move onto the next item

I'd like to add that sales have fallen

I'd like to add that we did everything we could

[133]
On a side note,... : 주제를 벗어나자면
On a side note, the results were amazing

On a side node, other countries also got a lot of snow that year
So it wasn't just Korea
That was really good news for us, because our sales increased

[134]
Let's come back to ... : ~으로 다시 오겠습니다.
Let's come back to the slide

Let's come back to the matter of overseas offices

But I want to stress that no one was hurt during the storm

[137]
For instance,... :예를 들어, ~
For instance, ABC Corp. has successfully entered the North American market

Consumers change brands all the time. And they do it for many different reasons.
For instance, let's say a woman gets married
On her honeymoon, she starts to use her husband's brand of toothpaste

[138]
That is why... 그런 이유로 ~

In the same way,... : 마찬가지로 ~
In the same way, we can do a beta test

[140]
On the other hand, ... : 반면에~

[145]
Let's compare...:~을 비교해 보겠습니다.
Let's compare the two types

Let's compare our product with a competitor's

Let me finish with this quote

[158]
It's essential for us to... : ~하는 건 필수입니다.
It's essential for us to receive payment in advance

We've all been doing business together since 2002
And this project is our largest one yet.
So it's essential for us to work out our different

[159]
...is less of a priority. : ~은 우선 사항이 아닙니다.
That is less of a priority

Renovating the existing stores is less of a priority
We plan to do that in phases.
What we want to focus on is creating a brand new concept together

[160]
Now, why don't we... your~? : 이제 그쪽 ~을 ...해 볼까요?
Now, why don't we hear from your side?

That's why we asked you to meet with us today.
Do you have any questions at this point?
All right
Now, why don't we take a look at your drawings?


[161]
Is that ...? :그게 ~인가요?
Is that a fair summary of your position?

July and August are not good months for us

Actually, not the whole summer. It's just those two months

[162]
Your priority, then, is ... : 그럼~이 우선 사항이네요
Your priority, then, is the cost

More than anything, innovation is what makes us who we are.
I see. Your priority, then, is being able to showcase the new design.
Not just the design. We want to be able to flaunt the new functions as well.

[163]
So you're offering...? : 그럼 ~을 제안하시는 건가요?

So you're offering a compromise?

I have to say, we're pretty impressed with your client list
We'd like to explore the possibility of working with you
So, you're offering a contract?
Well, obviously we have to work out a few critical issues first

[164]
Could you be more specific about...?
Could you be more specific about the date?

The Latin America market holds great potential
We think you can help us to look into the market
Could you b more specific about our possible?
We'd like you to conduct a series of market research

[165]
To be more specific ... : 더 자세히 말씀드리자면..
To be more specific the landscaping price is 10% over our budget

To be more specific, we can only allow FDA-approved drugs.
Does that mean drugs approved by EMA are also excluded?
Yes, I'm afraid so.

[166]
Maybe I should ... : ~해야겠습니다.
Maybe I should clarify that.

Maybe I should give you a real-life example.
Last year, there was a strike at a supplier's factory
It lasted over a month. Everyone lost out.

[167]
How important is... to you? : ~이 그쪽에게 얼마나 중요한가요?
How important is that to you?

How important is R&D to you?
Obviously, it's important. Why do you ask?
Well, we have one of the best research facilities in Korea.
That means we can customize the product to your needs

We would require... : ~이 있어야 합니다.
We would require a letter of credit

We would require a formal proposal. Otherwise, we can't obtain an approval.

[169]
That would depend on... : 그건 ~에 달려 있습니다/ 그건 ~에 따라 달라집니다.
That would depend on you.

When can we expect the first order?
That would depend on the results of today's meeting.
If everything gets finalized, you could get an order as early as next week
Great. Shall we continue then?

[170]
We propose... : ~을 제안합니다.
We propose the following.

We propose a 50-50 joint venture
50-50? Would you be open to giving us a majority share? Mabye 51%?
I can appreciate why you would want that, Harriet
But, I'm afraid it would have to be an even split.

[171]
We're prepared to...: ~할 의향이 있습니다.
We're prepared to offer a new deal.

We're prepared to offer you a sizable discount.
That's goo to hear. We appreciate that.
But in return, we would need for you to sign a confidentiality agreement

[172]
I'm afraid that's a little...: 유감이지만, 그건 좀 ~입니다.
I'm afraid that's a little risky

How soon can you get your engineers to our offices?
It depends on when we conclude our discussions. But we probably could have them in Seattle in two weeks

[173]
Perhaps we could consider... : ~을 고려해 보면 좋을듯 합니다.
Perpaps we could consider a new approach.

Your landscaping estimate is 20% higher than our own. So what do we do?
Perhaps we could consider decreasing the number of tress.
That would be impossible. If anything, we need more trees.

[174]
We can accept that if you... : ~을 하면 수락하겠습니다.
We can accept that if you reduce the price.

We would like to ask for a 5% discount on this particular item. How about it?
That's a rather steep cut. All right, how about this? We can accept that if you pay for shipping.
Let's take a short break so my team can discuss it.
