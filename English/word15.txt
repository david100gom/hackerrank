I think that's a great idea

What is your view on Bert's commnent?

I agree with him.

Annie, you don't look convinced. You don't agree?

I'm not sure I agree with them.

I'm not sure I agree with either you or Tina.

That's a good point, but... : 일리는 있지만~

That's a good point, but I can't agree.

I'm convinced we should reject their offer. It's way too low.

Maybe we should adjourn for now.

All right, everyone, let's just stop right there.
We're not getting anywhere discussing this item to death
