Let's 동사원형 : ~ 하자

Let's order one quick
Let's go play tennis
Let's face it
Let's get this started as soon as possible
Let's get him a drink
Let's get serious, bro
Let's ask if anyone wants to do this
Let's go get some coffee
Yeah, I'd like to get an Americano. What about you?

It's not worth ~ 할 가치가 없어

It's not worth the effort
It's not worth it
It's not worth the risk
It's not worth spending that much money on this
It's not worth my time reading it
It's not worth building a wall
It's not worth living

It's not worth investing in the stock market
I'm willing to take a risk. I heard that the stock market is doing really well these days
