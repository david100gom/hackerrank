I forgot to cancel the subscription
I forgot to tell you something
I forgot to bring my smartphone.
I forgot to change my clothes
I forgot to give you a receipt
I forgot to call you and tell you I wouldn't be able to make it to your wedding
I forgot to say that children under the age of 14 must be accompanied by an adult
I forgot to tell you I need to drive tonight
I was gonna ask you out for a drink. That's okay. We can just have dinner

I should have 과거분사 (p.p) ~할걸 그랬어

I should have done that
I should have done this a long time ago 
I should have asked her out on a date back then, instead of waiting this long
I should have taken care of my dog more carefully
I should have taken my father's advice and got that job
I should have told you I was bringing my girlfriend
I should have turned down that offer
