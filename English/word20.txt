I should have 과거분사 (p.p) ~할걸 그랬어

I should have asked her out on a date back then, instead of waiting this long
I should have taken care of my dog more carefully
I should have taken my father's advice and got that job

I should have turned down that offer

I almost forgot to tell you this. Your son is playing soccer with other kids

At first I thought he was joking, but then I realized he was not.
At first I thought it was useless, but then I realized it was very useful

At first, I thought it was too expensive, but now I see why

It's getting ~해져 가고 있다
It's getting worse every year

It's getting dark
It's getting better and better
It's getting closer
It's getting stronger and stronger
It's getting pretty serious
It's getting pretty complicated at this point

I think I gotta go. It's getting late
It's a shame you have to go. How about I drive you home?

[80]
I didn't realize (that) 주어+동사 - 나 ~인 줄 몰랐어
I didn't realize the fine dust was so bad

I didn't realize you wanted to get some advice from me
I didn't realize how late it was
I didn't realize you were going to be here
I didn't realize I hurt you that much
I didn't realize I didn't lock the door
I didn't realize you were the mayor of the city

I'm getting hungry. I didn't realize I was awake for 24 hours without a single meal
Let's go get some pizza. Then you gotta get some sleep for sure
