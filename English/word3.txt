Sorry, I think

Sorry, I think we got disconnected.
Sorry, I think we have a bad connection.
Sorry, I think there's too much static.
Sorry, I think you're breaking up.
Sorry, I think we might get cut off.

Sorry, I think my battery is running out.
Oh, that's what it is. What do you want to do?
I'll need to recharge it before I can call you back.
