The last time we ... was ~

The last time we talked was in July
The last time we saw each other was last year
The last time we met was in 2010
The last time we negotiated was years ago.


It's been a long time, Molly
Yeah, long time. The last time we did something like this was 2 years ago?
Oh, it might actually be longer than that. Maybe 3 years.
Wow, how time flies.
