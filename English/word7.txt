Paula, you've heard Steve's opinion. What's your view on that?
I need more information before I can fully agree, but...

But,
But Steve does have a point.

[103]

As I see it ...
As I see it, they are doing a bad job.
As I see it, that is mistake.
As I see it, the budget is too low
As I see it, there's only one solution.
As I see it, we need to focus on delivery

As I see it, we would need three people for that.
Can you elaborate on that?
One person has to operate the forklift. Another assists, and the last person takes inventory
I see what you mean.

[104]
I think that's ...

I think that's a great idea.
I think that's a bad idea
I think that's the clear-cut solution
I don't think that's the right decision
I don't think that's what he said

What is your ivew on Bert's comment?
I don't think that's a good idea.
Why not?
Because we don't have all the data yet. So we would only be making an assumption

[105]

I agree with...

I agree with him.
I agree with that.
I agree with the first point
I totally agree with everything you said.
I sort of agree with you

Annie, you don't look convinced. you don't agree?
Well, I agree with most of what you said
Most? Which part don't you agree with?
I don't agree with the part about the supplier. We should go with a different supplier

I'm not sure I agree with them.
I'm not sure I agree with you.
I'm not sure I agree with his plan.
I'm not sure I agree with that point
I'm not sure I agree with the last opinion


I'm not sure I agree with either you or Tina
Why not?
Neither of you have a solution that's viable
Can I hear your opinion then? What would you suggest?

[107]
That's good point, but..

That's good point, but I can't agree
That's good point, but what about the second problem?
That's good point, but we need something more concrete
That's good point, but you left out an important issue.

I'm convinced we should reject their offer. It's way too low
That's good point, but what choice do we have?
I don't think it's about choices. It's about profits
Yes, it is about profits. But we have no other choice.

[108]
Sorry, can I interrupt you for a second?
Sorry, can I say something here?
Sorry, can I just add something>
Sorry, can I ask you to repeat that?
Sorry, can I comment on that?

Yoon has already agreed to go with me, So I think...
Sorry, can I interrupt you right there?
Sure, Yoon. You have something to add?

No, I just want to clarify that I didn't agree to go with you.
