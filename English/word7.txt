[101]
Let's start with ....

Let's start with the first item
Let's start with old business
Let's start with the presentation
Let's start with a recap of our last meeting

Let's start with Tina's report. Tina, are you all set to go?
Yeah, I am ready
Okay, what do you have for us today.


[102]
What's your view on ... ?


What's your view on this?
What's your view on all this?
What's your view on his comment?
What's your view on the proposal?
What's your view on her suggestion?

Paula, you've heard Steve's opinion. What's your view on that?
I need more information before I can fully agree, but...

But,
But Steve does have a point.

[103]

As I see it ...
As I see it, they are doing a bad job.
As I see it, that is mistake.
As I see it, the budget is too low
As I see it, there's only one solution.
As I see it, we need to focus on delivery

As I see it, we would need three people for that.
Can you elaborate on that?
One person has to operate the forklift. Another assists, and the last person takes inventory
I see what you mean.

[104]
I think that's ...

I think that's a great idea.
I think that's a bad idea
I think that's the clear-cut solution
I don't think that's the right decision
I don't think that's what he said

What is your ivew on Bert's comment?
I don't think that's a good idea.
Why not?
Because we don't have all the data yet. So we would only be making an assumption

[105]

I agree with...

I agree with him.
I agree with that.
I agree with the first point
I totally agree with everything you said.
I sort of agree with you

Annie, you don't look convinced. you don't agree?
Well, I agree with most of what you said
Most? Which part don't you agree with?
I don't agree with the part about the supplier. We should go with a different supplier


[106]
I'm not sure I agree with ...

I'm not sure I agree with them.
I'm not sure I agree with you.
I'm not sure I agree with his plan.
I'm not sure I agree with that point
I'm not sure I agree with the last opinion


I'm not sure I agree with either you or Tina
Why not?
Neither of you have a solution that's viable
Can I hear your opinion then? What would you suggest?

[107]
That's good point, but..

That's good point, but I can't agree
That's good point, but what about the second problem?
That's good point, but we need something more concrete
That's good point, but you left out an important issue.

I'm convinced we should reject their offer. It's way too low
That's good point, but what choice do we have?
I don't think it's about choices. It's about profits
Yes, it is about profits. But we have no other choice.

[108]
Sorry, can I interrupt you for a second?
Sorry, can I say something here?
Sorry, can I just add something>
Sorry, can I ask you to repeat that?
Sorry, can I comment on that?

Yoon has already agreed to go with me, So I think...
Sorry, can I interrupt you right there?
Sure, Yoon. You have something to add?

No, I just want to clarify that I didn't agree to go with you.


[109]

Could you .. ?

Could you give me an example?
Could you explain that more in detail?
Could you clarify that?
Could you be more specific?
Could you tell me why?

We don't know when the board will meet.
You know, I heard they're meeting next week. Friday, I think.
Could you tell me where you got that information.?
I got it from a reliable source. A board member told me.


[110]
Are you saying (that) .... ?

Are you saying (that) we should do nothing?
Are you saying (that) we need to redo the landscaping?
Are you saying (that) I take it up with the client?
Are you saying (that) you will do it?

I don't understand why the generator won't start. That's your specialty, isn't it?
Look, we did everything by the book. and we double-checked everything
Are you saying that it is our fault?
I'm not saying that at all. I don't think it's anyone's fault.



[111]

What I mean is ...

What I mean is I don't agree.
What I mean is you're right.
What I mean is we have to stop dealing with them.
What I mean is the CEO probably won't agree.

Barbara, our company is now in the top ten
Yes, but in terms of technology, we're not there yet.
What do you mean by "not there yet"?
What I mean is we're still purchasing key components


[112]
How about -ing ?

How about creating a TFT?
How about calling a meeting?
How about postponing the opening?
How about simply letting them continue?
How about just going through with it?

What exactly is the problem?
We have a bug in the software. It will take some time to fix it.
How about delaying the launch? The date hasn't been announced yet
You're right. I guess that's what we will have to


[113]
We have to act decisively.
We have to restructure
We have to expand into new markets.
We have to stop the project now.
We have to recognize their contribution

So how do we remedy this situation? Issue a massive recall?
We have to call a press conference. And we have to do that immediately
And then what would we tell the reporters?
We tell them the truth

[114]
Does anyone...?

Does anyone have an opinion about this?
Does anyone agree with Harry?
Does anyone disagree with that?
Does anyone want to add anything?
Does anyone have a different view?


Does anyone want to propose a different option?
I do. I think we should consider building the factory in Ulsan.
Ah, that's certainly different from Mary's opinion. Why Ulsan?
We already have supplier there. In China, we don't

[115]
Let's hear from Ted.
Let's hear from the task force team
Let's hear from this side of the room
Let's hear from someone else


Thank you, AI, for your thoughts
Okay, we got a lot of opinions from the project team, but we heard nothing form the head office staff.
So Let's hear from Mr Kim

[116]
Maybe we should...


Maybe we should adjourn for now
Maybe we should take a short break
Maybe we should table it
Maybe we should discuss this in detail.
Maybe we should put it to a vote

All right, everyone, let's just stop right there
We're not getting anywhere discussing this item to death
Maybe we should come back to it later.
Thanks, Stella. That's an excellent idea.

[117]
Now, let's move onto the next item.

Now, let's move onto another item.
Now, let's move onto the last topic
Now, let's move onto the issue of staffing.

I think that's everything we want to discuss on that.
Now let's move onto a different item
We need to discuss the ongoing problem of inventory control

[118]
We'll deal with this item next time.
We'll discuss the scheduling next time
We'll vote on the proposal next time
We'll make the decision next time
We'll hear your report next time

Unfortunately, we're out of time
We'll talk about this item again next time
Okay, I think we've covered everything.

[119]
Before we finish, is there any...?

Before we finish, is there anything I missed?
Before we finish, is there any other business?
Before we finish, is there any questions?
Before we finish, is there any more ideas?
Before we finish, is there any last comments?

Before we finish, is there anything else?
Yeah, I have a quick question.
Sure, Jane. What is it?
Did you want me to join the new team? I wasn't sure.

[120]
Why don't I summarize the main points?
Why don't I summarize everything we discussed?
Why don't I summarize the important decisions?
Why don't I summarize what we accomplished today?

Why don't I summarize the key issues we discussed today?
