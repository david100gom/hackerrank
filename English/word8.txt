We can see an increase over time
We can see a difference here
We can see a definite change during the summer months
We can see that viewership peaked in August

Let's compare the two types
Let's compare the three designs
Let's compare the styles
Let's compare Korea to Japan
Let's compare the black version with the white one

Let's compare our product with a competitor's

Sales have rapidly increased.
Sales have steadily decreased
Sales have recovered last month
Sales have nearly doubled

The change is due to a lot of different things

The change is partly due to the product's growing popularity
Another reason is better management.

That covers all the points

And yes, we expect a huge turnout
That covers my talk on the new water park
