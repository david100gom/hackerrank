We can see an increase over time
We can see a difference here
We can see a definite change during the summer months
We can see that viewership peaked in August
We can see that the new TV commercial helped sales

Let me just pause here to talk about this bar graph
See the drop after 2010? We can see that there was a problem in the following year.

[145]
Let's compare the two types
Let's compare the three designs
Let's compare the styles
Let's compare Korea to Japan
Let's compare the black version with the white one

Let's compare our product with a competitor's
While ours has more features, theirs is cheaper
The big question is which one will come out on top in the marketplace

[146]
Sales have rapidly increased.
Sales have steadily decreased
Sales have recovered last month
Sales have nearly doubled
Sales have been improving

Now, let's look at this quarter's financial data in detail
Sales have been falling since November
And profits have been going down, too

[147]
The change is due to mismanagement
The change is due to a lot of different things
The change is due to the recent economic downturn
The change is due to the factors shown on this chart
The change is partly due to this year's unusually dry weather.

Here we see a steady growth in profits
The change is partly due to the product's growing popularity
Another reason is better management.

[148]
That covers my presentation
That covers everything I wanted to say
That covers my talk on the new drug
That covers all the points

Finally, Auqa Damyang is scheduled to open this summer
And yes, we expect a huge turnout
That covers my talk on the new water park

[149]
Let me finish with this quote
Let me finish with a short summary
Let me finish with a suggestion
Let me finish by repeating the main points
Let me finish by stressing the last point

Let me finish with a recent photo of downtown Seoul
So why am I showing this?
I show this so you can all see how modern the city is.

[150]
Now, do you have any questions?
Now, do you have any comments?
Now, do you have any ideas?
Now, do you have any stories you want to share?

Now, do you have any questions about the motor show?
Yes, you at the front? Your name?
Yeah, I'm Julianne with GT Motors
Hi Julianne. What is your question?

[151]
That's a great question
That's an excellent question
That's a very valid question
That's an interesting question

Tina? You had a question?
Yeah. I was curious about how much each model costs.
That's a really good question. And I'm glad you asked that.

[152]
