The factorial of the integer n, written n!, is defined as:

n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)x....x3x2x1

Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.

For example, if n = 30, we calculate 30*29....*1 and get xxxxx

Function Descrition
Complete the extraLongFactorials function in the editor below. It should print the result and return.
extraLongFactorials has the following parameter(s)
- n: an integer

Note : Factorials of n > 2- can't be stored even in a 65 - bit long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations.
Languages like java, Python, Ruby etc can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.
We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.

Input Format
input consists of a single integer n

Constraints

Print the factorial of n
