We define a magic square to be an n*n matrix of distinct positive integers from 1 to n2 where the sum of any row, column, or diagonal of length n is always equal to the same
number : the magic constant

We will be given 3*3 matrix s of integers in the inclusive range [1,9]. we can convert any digit a to any other digit b in the range [1,9]
at cost of |a-b|. Given s, convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line.

Note : The resulting magic square must contain distinct integers in the inclusive range [1,9]
