Given a set of distinct integers, print the size of maximal subset of S where the sum of any 2 numbers in S'

For example, the array S=[19,10,12,10,24,25,22] and k=4. One of the arrays that can be created is S'[0] = [10,12,25]. another is S'[1] = [19,22,24]
After testing all permutations, the maximum length solution array has 2 elements.

Function Description
Complete the nonDivisibleSubset function in the editor below. It should return an integer representing the length of the longest subset of S meeting the criteria.
